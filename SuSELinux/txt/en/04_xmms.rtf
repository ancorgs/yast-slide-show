</p>
<p>
In the SuSE Linux distribution, you will find a wide variety of applications for 
playing back your favorite CDs or MP3 songs. Linux works like a stereo system, 
but with more convenient features. Put together a playlist, download song and 
album data from the Internet, and organize your music files just as you want 
them. Linux applications, such as XMMS or kscd, will help you do all this.
