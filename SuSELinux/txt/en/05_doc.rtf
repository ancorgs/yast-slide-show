<p>In the SUSE Help System, all available documentation is consolidated in a well-structured, easy-to-use portal. In addition to the KDE help, the portal provides access to more than 1,000 pages of SUSE LINUX documentation. Of course, the latest HOWTOs, FAQs, INFOs, READMEs, and man pages are available for experts. And last but not least, the source code is also included. Open Source software is transparent!</p>
