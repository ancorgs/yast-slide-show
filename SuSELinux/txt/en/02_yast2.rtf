has revolutionized the installation of Linux. It detects existing
Windows 95/98/ME partitions and offers meaningful suggestions for
apportioning the hard disk space and selecting software.</p>
<p>The SuSE allround utility helps you to set up your Internet
access, administer users, and install new programs. The hardware
detection was improved, enabling new hardware components to be
integrated and configured automatically. Thus, system administration
is child's play even for newcomers.</p>
