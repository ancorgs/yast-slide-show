<p>Linux is <b>the</b> outstanding <b>operating system for networks</b>. Its <b><font color=#669900>multitasking</font></b> and
astonishing <b><font color=#669900>multiuser capabilities</font></b> are so sophisticated that they have become the standard for efficient
networks.</p>
<p>In particular, multiuser management and impeccably designed data transfer methods make Linux the groundwork for a safe, flexible, and
user-friendly network -- for users as well as for system administrators. New machines can easily be integrated into the network. </p>
<p>Along with that comes the
<b><font color=#669900>Samba</font></b> Server, another milestone in the network arena, the basis for the administration of
heterogenous networks, smoothly consolidating Linux, Mac and Windows machines.</p>
