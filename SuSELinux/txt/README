			    YaST2 slide show texts
                           ========================

All texts must be encoded in UTF-8. You can either use an editor that can
handle that (e.g. "Yudit") or convert the texts to your favourite encoding
(e.g. Latin1 for western languages, Latin2 for most eastern European
languages), use your favourite editor and then convert them back to UTF-8:

	recode utf8..latin1 *.rtf
	emacs *.rtf
	recode latin1..utf8 *.rtf

This "recode" call changes the original files, so be careful!


The internal text format is what we call "rich text"; it is very much like
HTML, but doesn't quite support all features HTML does - and it doesn't use the
HTML standard headers. Stick to some examples if in doubt.

Don't use HTML character substitutes for national special characters - use a
literal "ä" rather than something like "&auml;".


The filenames may not be changed. They must be named like the slide show
images, just with a ".rtf" rather than ".jpg" or ".png" extension. Anything
else in those directories will be ignored.
