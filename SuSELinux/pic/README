			    YaST2 Slide Show Images
                           =========================

This directory contains the image files for the YaST2 slide show. All "*.jpg"
and "*.png" files in this directory will be displayed - in the same order as
"ls" shows them, so use file names that start with a multi-digit number. Use
leading zeroes as required, e.g.

	01_intro.jpg
	02_something.png
	03_somemore.jpg
	...
	10_morestuff.png

and NOT

	1_intro.jpg
	10_morestuff.jpg
	2_something.png
	3_somemore.jpg


The image files are the master. For every image a corresponding text file is
loaded from the "txt" directories. The text files are required to have the same
name as the image file - just the filename extension is different: ".jpg" or
".png" are stripped and substituted by ".rtf", so in this example the following
text files are loaded:

	01_intro.rtf
	02_something.rtf
	03_somemore.rtf
	...
	10_morestuff.rtf

The directory with the current YaST2 language is searched first. English is the
fallback if nothing is found there. If there is no corresponding text file, no
text will be displayed for this image.

If you are installing in German language, the directory search order is:

	slide/txt/de_DE
	slide/txt/de
	slide/txt/en_US
	slide/txt/en_GB
	slide/txt/en


It is generally not a good idea to change file names for slide show images or
texts unless absolutely necessary since a lot of other files depend on each
file.
